## General Information
- # Background of your project :   
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. 
- # Problem being solved :  
- The purpose of the project is to develop a CNN based model which can accurately classify the input images into appropriate skin cancer type. Model is trained to classify total 9 types of skin cancer. The special interest is to be able to detect Melanoma which is one of the deadliest cancer type. 
- # Dataset being used :  
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC.
